# simple-counter

Made a more built out counter (_much_ nicer than my first one lol) with some CSS styling and JS for when the number is positive or negative.

_Find link in description._

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was to reinforce my abilities with DOM manipulations and other basics like functions.

## Optimizations

Made some updates so that it's mobile friendly.

## Lessons Learned:

Don't forget your meta viewport tags in custom builds...lol. You will be confused.
